# Calculator App

This project is a simple calculator application implemented in C++ using the Qt framework. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logarithm. The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed using Qt widgets, featuring a responsive layout.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logarithm operations.
- User-friendly GUI with digit buttons, arithmetic operation buttons, and a display.
- Basic error handling for division by zero.
- Ability to move buttons for a personalized layout.

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this calculator app, I gained valuable experience in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The code is organized using classes and encapsulation to achieve a modular and maintainable structure. Additionally, I explored Qt's **signal-slot system** for managing user interactions, enhancing the interactivity of the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred C++ IDE.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Use the digit buttons, arithmetic operation buttons, and equals button to perform calculations.

Feel free to customize the application further and contribute to its development.
